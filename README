This game contains sounds from Erik Osterman's sample archive at
ftp.osterman.com/pub/music/samples.

What is downloadable as the "soundtrack" to this game is just random tracker
music picked up on the internet. As far as I know, these songs should
be freely redistributable if unmodified. For credits, please
see the individual song files.
